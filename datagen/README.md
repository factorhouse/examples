# Data Generation Scripts

This directory contains scripts for simulating real-time data streams in various scenarios. These tools are especially useful for developing and testing streaming data pipelines.

We recommend using these scripts in conjunction with the local development environments provided by [Factor House Local](https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local).
