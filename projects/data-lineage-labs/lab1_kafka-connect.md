# A Practical Guide to Data Lineage on Kafka Connect with OpenLineage

This guide provides a complete, end-to-end solution for capturing real-time data lineage from **Kafka Connect**. By the end of this tutorial, we will have a fully functional environment that tracks data from a source connector, through Kafka, and into data sinks like S3 and Apache Iceberg, with the entire graph visualized in [Marquez](https://marquezproject.github.io/marquez/).

The core of this solution is the **`OpenLineageLifecycleSmt`**, a custom Single Message Transform (SMT) that enables automated lineage without modifying our data records. We will walk through its setup, configuration, and limitations to provide a comprehensive understanding of how to achieve lineage for Kafka Connect pipelines.

## OpenLineage Kafka Connect SMT

While Apache Kafka is not a natively [supported integration](https://openlineage.io/docs/integrations/about/) in OpenLineage, lineage tracking can be enabled for Kafka Connect using the **`OpenLineageLifecycleSmt`** Single Message Transform (SMT), which is included in _Factor House Local_.

The custom SMT enables fully automated, real-time data lineage by emitting OpenLineage events to a compatible backend (such as Marquez). It acts as a **pass-through transform**: records are not modified, but lifecycle hooks in Kafka Connect are used to capture and report rich metadata about data pipelines.

### Supported connectors

The SMT is designed to work with multiple Kafka Connect source and sink connectors. Currently, it supports:

- **Source connectors**
  - Amazon MSK Data Generator (`com.amazonaws.mskdatagen.GeneratorSourceConnector`)
- **Sink connectors**
  - Confluent S3 Sink Connector (`io.confluent.connect.s3.S3SinkConnector`)
  - Iceberg Sink Connector (`io.tabular.iceberg.connect.IcebergSinkConnector`)

### Datasets creation

The SMT automatically discovers input and output datasets based on the explicit configuration we provide to it.

- **Kafka topic datasets**

  - **Identification:** The SMT identifies Kafka topics from the `topics` property in its configuration.
  - **Direction:** It uses the `connector.class` property to determine if the topics are **inputs** (for a sink connector) or **outputs** (for a source connector).
  - **Namespace and name:** For lineage purposes, each Kafka topic is treated as a distinct dataset.
    - The dataset **name** is the topic name itself (e.g., `orders`).
    - The dataset **namespace** is the canonical URI of the Kafka cluster, constructed by prepending `kafka://` to the bootstrap server address (e.g., `kafka://kafka-1:19092`). This ensures consistent identification across different systems like Flink.
  - **Schema:** When `key.converter.schema.read` or `value.converter.schema.read` is set to _true_, the SMT connects to the Schema Registry to fetch the latest schema for keys, values, or both. This enables rich, column-level lineage tracking. We must also provide supporting properties like the Schema Registry URL and authentication info.
    > **Note:** Currently, the SMT's schema parsing logic is implemented specifically for the **Avro** format. Schemas of other types (e.g., Protobuf, JSON Schema) will not be parsed, and column-level lineage will not be available for those topics.

- **Sink output datasets (S3 & Iceberg)**
  For sink connectors, the SMT creates a one-to-one mapping from each input Kafka topic to a corresponding output dataset in the target system.

  - **S3 sink connectors**

    - **Configuration:** Requires the `dataset.namespace` property.
    - **Dataset namespace:** The namespace for the output dataset is set by the `dataset.namespace` property (e.g., `s3://fh-dev-bucket`).
    - **Dataset names:** The names of the output datasets are the **names of the input Kafka topics**. For example, data from the `orders` topic will be represented as an S3 dataset named `orders` within the specified namespace.

  - **Iceberg sink connectors**

    - **Configuration:** Requires the `dataset.namespace` and `dataset.names` properties.
    - **Dataset namespace:** The namespace for the output dataset is set by the `dataset.namespace` property (e.g., `s3://warehouse`).
      - This namespace can be either the logical name (e.g., `thrift://hive-metastore:9083`) or the physical name (e.g., `s3://warehouse`). Because the OpenLineage Spark integration reports the physical name by default, using the physical name is recommended for downstream compatibility.
    - **Dataset names:** The names of the output datasets are determined by the `dataset.names` property. Unlike the S3 sink connector, the physical dataset name can be different from the topic name, so the mapping should be specified explicitly.

  - **Schema inheritance**
    For both S3 and Iceberg sinks, the SMT intelligently reuses the Avro schema it fetches from the connector's _input topic_ and attaches it to the sink's _output dataset_ event. This provides complete, end-to-end column-level lineage from Kafka into the final data store.

### Lifecycle & status management

Among the OpenLineage [job statuses](https://openlineage.io/docs/spec/run-cycle/), the SMT tracks **RUNNING**, **COMPLETE**, and **FAIL**.

- [❌] **START** - marks the beginning of a job run
- [✅] **RUNNING** - used during execution to emit intermediate or progress-related metadata
- [✅] **COMPLETE** - signals successful job completion
- [❌] **ABORT** - indicates a job that's been stopped prematurely
- [✅] **FAIL** - indicates a job run failure
- [❌] **OTHER** - for any additional, non-standard events added before terminal states

**RUNNING**

- **Trigger:** This event is emitted from the `apply()` method upon processing the first record.
  - **If schema reading is enabled:** The event is sent only _after_ the SMT confirms that all required schemas are available in the Schema Registry. This ensures the lineage is created with the correct, validated schema.
  - **If schema reading is disabled:** The event is sent immediately on the first record.
- **Event details:** This is a **rich event** containing the full input and output datasets, including schemas if available. It provides immediate visibility of the job's full lineage graph as soon as it begins processing data.

**FAIL**

- **Trigger:** An unhandled exception is caught during record processing in the `apply()` method.
- **Event details:** A **minimal `FAIL` event** is emitted. The SMT then re-throws the original exception to ensure Kafka Connect's native error handling (e.g., dead-letter queue) can proceed.

**COMPLETE**

- **Trigger:** The SMT's `close()` method is called by the Kafka Connect framework during a graceful shutdown, such as when a connector is deleted or a task is reconfigured.
- **Event details:** A **minimal `COMPLETE` event** is emitted.
- **Reasoning:** The SMT itself cannot distinguish between a user-initiated stop (which would logically be an `ABORT`) and a planned reconfiguration. Because `close()` represents a clean, error-free termination of the current run, `COMPLETE` is used as the most reliable and consistent final status.

### Namespaces

The SMT applies a consistent, location-based namespacing strategy to uniquely identify datasets and maintain correct linkages with external systems such as Flink. Environment variables are set within the Kafka Connect Docker instance, while S3 and Iceberg dataset details are specified through connector properties.

| Entity                 | Namespace Source                              | Example                                  | Purpose                                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job**                | `OPENLINEAGE_NAMESPACE` environment variable. | `fh-local`                               | Provides a logical grouping for related jobs. This should be consistent across our Kafka Connect and Flink deployments.                        |
| **Kafka Dataset**      | `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP` environment variable.       | `kafka://kafka-1:19092`                  | Creates a canonical, physical identifier for the Kafka cluster, allowing datasets to be shared and linked across different jobs and platforms. |
| **S3/Iceberg Dataset** | `dataset.namespace` connector property.       | `s3://fh-dev-bucket` or `s3://warehouse` | Uniquely identifies the the physical storage. Note Spark reports the physical name.                                                            |

### Limitations

- **`tasks.max` must Be `1`:** This SMT is designed for single-task connectors. It manages its state internally for each instance. To ensure a clean, one-to-one mapping between a connector and a single OpenLineage run, we **must** set `"tasks.max": "1"` in the connector configuration.
- **Initial connector failures:** If a connector fails during its own initialization _before_ any records are processed, the SMT will not have a chance to emit a `START` or `FAIL` event.
- **Schema versioning on redeployment:** The SMT waits for schemas to exist before emitting lineage, avoiding race conditions. However, it does not track schema **version changes**. Updating a topic schema (e.g., adding a field) will not create a new dataset version in Marquez.

## Kafka Connect configuration

[Factor House Local](https://github.com/factorhouse/factorhouse-local) ships with a Kafka Connect instance that has the `OpenLineageLifecycleSmt` pre-installed. The SMT is integrated through volume mapping and is available within the **Kpow environment** (`compose-kpow.yml`).

The following environment variables must be configured for the SMT:

- **`OPENLINEAGE_URL`** – The OpenLineage API endpoint (e.g., `http://marquez-api:5000`).
- **`OPENLINEAGE_NAMESPACE`** – A logical namespace used to organize Kafka Connect jobs (e.g., `fh-local`).
- **`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP`** – The address of the first Kafka bootstrap server (e.g., `kafka-1:19092`), used when constructing the dataset namespace.

The snippet below shows the OpenLineage integration details for the `connect` service configuration:

```yaml
connect:
  image: confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect:7.8.0
  container_name: connect
  ...
  ports:
    - 8083:8083
  ...
  environment:
    ...
    CONNECT_PLUGIN_PATH: /usr/share/java/,/etc/kafka-connect/jars,/etc/kafka-connect/plugins
    ## OpenLineage Configuration
    OPENLINEAGE_URL: http://marquez-api:5000
    OPENLINEAGE_NAMESPACE: fh-local
    KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP: "kafka-1:19092"
  volumes:
    - ./resources/deps/kafka/connector:/etc/kafka-connect/jars
    - ./resources/kpow/plugins:/etc/kafka-connect/plugins
```

### Connector deployment

Individual connectors can be configured to use the SMT by adding the transform details to their configuration. The following connectors are available as examples:

- [**Source Connector**](./connectors/orders-source.json): Ingests mock order data into the `orders` topic using the _Amazon MSK Data Generator_.
- [**S3 Sink Connector**](./connectors/orders-s3-sink.json): Reads records from the `orders` topic and writes them to an object storage bucket (MinIO).
- [**Iceberg Sink Connector**](./connectors/orders-iceberg-sink.json): Reads records from the `orders` topic and writes them to an Iceberg table.

CREATE TABLE demo_ib.`default`.orders (
    order_id STRING,
    item STRING,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    supplier STRING,
    bid_time TIMESTAMP

    'write.metadata.previous-versions-max' = '3',
    'write.delete.mode' = 'copy-on-write',
    'write.update.mode' = 'copy-on-write'
);
```

<summary><b>Deploying connectors with multiple topics</b></summary>

<br/>

We can deploy connectors that work with multiple topics. In this example, two topics are used: **orders** and **bids**. The corresponding connector configuration files are available here:

- [Source connector](./connectors/multi-topic-source.json)
- [S3 sink connector](./connectors/multi-topic-s3-sink.json)
- [Iceberg sink connector](./connectors/multi-topic-iceberg-sink.json)

**Note:** For the Iceberg sink connector, a new table (`default.bids`) must be created.

```sql
CREATE TABLE demo_ib.`default`.bids (
    order_id STRING,
    price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    supplier STRING,
    bid_time TIMESTAMP
)
USING iceberg
PARTITIONED BY (DAY(bid_time))
TBLPROPERTIES (
    'format-version' = '2',
    'write.format.default' = 'parquet',
    'write.target-file-size-bytes' = '134217728',
    'write.parquet.compression-codec' = 'snappy',
    'write.metadata.delete-after-commit.enabled' = 'true',
    'write.metadata.previous-versions-max' = '3',
    'write.delete.mode' = 'copy-on-write',
    'write.update.mode' = 'copy-on-write'
);
```
